Simulation of urban dynamics and socioeconomic segregation using NetLogo to model and analyze the impact of different urban policies on social stratification.

## üìã Project Description

This project implements a cellular automaton that simulates a city with **different social classes** and ** service entities**, developed as part of the Artificial Life course at Universidad del Valle. The simulation models how various urban policies affect the spatial distribution and evolution of social classes over time.

**Team Members:**
- Juan David Cata√±o Castillo (202160227)
- Valentina Londo√±o Due√±as (202160173)

**Presentation Date:** June 2024

## üéØ Objectives

- Model a virtual city with distinct social classes (high, middle, low)
- Implement service entities that influence urban development (hospitals, universities, stores)
- Simulate the impact of different urban policies on socioeconomic segregation
- Analyze the evolution of socioeconomic indicators under various political scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Tools

The project was developed following these steps:

1.  **Model Design:** Definition of cellular attributes (social class, income, services, education).
2.  **Implementation:** Programming the cellular automaton in NetLogo with evolution rules.
3.  **Simulation:** Execution of scenarios under different urban policies.
4.  **Analysis:** Observation of emergent patterns and measurement of socioeconomic indicators.

**Main Tool:** [NetLogo - Multi-agent programmable modeling environment](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

## üìä Model Characteristics

The cellular automaton includes the following properties:

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `is-high-class?` | Indicates if belongs to high social class |
| `is-middle-class?` | Indicates if belongs to middle social class |
| `is-low-class?` | Indicates if belongs to low social class |
| `is-hospital?` | Indicates if it's a hospital entity |
| `is-university?` | Indicates if it's a university entity |
| `is-store?` | Indicates if it's a store entity |
| `cell-income` | Economic income of the cell |
| `cell-services` | Service accessibility level (1, 2, 3) |
| `cell-education` | Education level (1, 2, 3) |
| `IPM-value` | Value to determine social class |

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

**Requirement:** NetLogo installed (version 6.3.0 or higher)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/valtimore/Segregacion-Simulada.git
    ```

2.  **Open the file in NetLogo:**
    - Launch NetLogo
    - Go to `File  -> Open` and select `SegregacionFinal.nlogo`

3.  **Simulation controls:**
    - `Extinci√≥n`: Removes all existing population
    - `Nacimiento`: Generates new population according to configurations
    - `Iniciar`: Executes the simulation

4.  **Monitors:**
    - `Total clase baja`: Quantity of low-class individuals
    - `Total clase media`: Quantity of middle-class individuals
    - `Total clase alta`: Quantity of high-class individuals
    - `Clase`: Social class of the cell under cursor
    - `Informaci√≥n Ingresos`: Income of the cell under cursor
    - `Informaci√≥n servicios`: Service level of the cell under cursor
    - `Informaci√≥n Educaci√≥n`: Education level of the cell under cursor

## üìà Urban Policy Scenarios

The model allows simulation of three different policies:

### üèòÔ∏è Normalidad
Realistic simulation where wealth clusters in specific sectors with little variation. Critical sectors receive no external help.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Equidad
Policy of economic assistance toward vulnerable sectors. High and middle classes pay taxes directed to the low class, stabilizing purchasing power.

### üí∞ Capitalismo Salvaje
Extreme scenario where the high class monopolizes all income, simulating corruption phenomena.

## üìä Metrics and Analysis

The model allows observation of::
- Spatial distribution of social classes.
- Temporal evolution of socioeconomic indicators.
- Impact of policies on social mobility.
- Emergent patterns of urban segregation.

## üìö Conclusion and Future Perspectives

The simulation enables analysis of how different urban policies affect socioeconomic segregation and spatial wealth distribution. As future work, we propose:

- Incorporate more demographic and economic variables
- Model migration between different city areas
- Implement more granular policy interventions
- Connect the model with real urban data for validation
